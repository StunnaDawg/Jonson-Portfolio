# Jonson's Portfolio

## Description
This is a Portfolio website that shows off my work to potential employers. The website was built using HTML5 and CSS3 languages. The webpage includes a section About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact Me section.

I built this webpage so future employers have a webpage to be able to visit and see my projects.

In the process I learned how to utilize flexbox and Grid together to create a responsive website.
